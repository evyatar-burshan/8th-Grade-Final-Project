# 8th-Grade-Final-Project
This is Lemonade Stand Simulator!  For the next few days you will be selling lemonade to the people of Lemüçãnville, trying to earn as much money as possible!

Tutorial:
The goal of this game is to acquire as much money as possible in 7 days.


To acquire money (symbolized as üåï) you'll need to sell lemonade to the people of Lemüçãnville.


Each day you'll need to buy lemons, water, ice & sugar to make your lemonade. Then, you will be tasked with making THE PERFECT lemonade recipe (You can use a decimal point), by adjusting the amounts of your lemons, water, ice & sugar.


The measurements are:
8 Spoon = 100 Grams,
70 Spoons = 1 Liter,
1 Ice Tray = 16 Ice Cubes,
1 Lemon Bag = 10 Lemons.


But that's not all, Lemüçãnville is known for it's CrAzY weather. So you'll need to adjust the recipe and the price accordingly.


Tip: Default measurments for a lemonade cup are close to real life! 1 Lemon, 8 sp Water, 4 sp Sugar and 2 Ice cubes! (worth about 3üåï)


So you've created you're recipe, watched today's forecast, now all you need is to name your price! When you set a price we reccomend you consider: The weather, the price of your stock, how much stock you have and what people will think of the price.


Then you'll need to make as much lemonade as you think customers will buy. Any lemonade left at the end of the day will be thrown away.


At the end of each day you'll get a summary of how the day went and will be able to buy upgrades.


        ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è  PLEASE NOTICE ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è 
you will NOT be able to buy more stock or change the recipe during the day. So make sure you don't give anyone diabetes and let's start!
